Computer Graphics Programs 

These are the lab works I completed during my University in the Computer Graphics Module. It includes 4 labs with each lab learning and building upon different concepts from the lectures. 

Lab 1: Introduction to WEBGL, Drawing Operations, Shader Syntax.
Lab 2: Affine Transformations. Projection Matrix, Modelview Matrix, clipping, frustum in 3D. 
Lab 3: Blinn Phong implementation on GPU, Light and material properties, per-fragment and per-vertex lighting, FS Shaders, bump mapping, cel-shading. 
Lab 4: Textures, texture filtering, environment map, combining texture, lighting and reflecting, mapping texture from images, alpha and gamma transformation to images, vignetting, and 2D image effects.
